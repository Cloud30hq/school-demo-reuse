# School Demo Template

Modern, animated, mobile-friendly school website template using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Files

- `index.html`: Structure and sections
- `styles.css`: Theme, layout, responsive behavior, visual style
- `script.js`: Reusable data config, content rendering, smooth scroll, animations
- `vercel.json`: Vercel-friendly static settings

## Quick Reuse

Edit only `siteConfig` in `script.js` to reuse this template for another school:

- Name, tagline, contact details
- City text in hero (`city`)
- Programs
- Program outcomes bullets (`outcomes`)
- Gallery/campus images
- Stories/testimonials
- Scrolling signal strip content

The layout uses alternating section moods (dark/light) and built-in conversion bands for better admissions flow.

## Deploy On Vercel

1. Import this folder as a project.
2. Framework preset: `Other`.
3. Build command: leave empty.
4. Output directory: root (`.`).

The site is static and deploys directly.
